    <h2>Where I am currently at</h2>
    <p>
      I currently live in Bethlehem, Palestine.
      <br />
      Bethlehem, the town where I grew up, is a very special place in Palestine.
      It's famous all around the world because it's where Jesus was born a long, long time ago.
      Bethlehem is a cozy town with narrow streets and lots of delicious food. My favorite is falafel! We have colorful
      markets with all kinds of sweets and toys.
      But we also have to deal with some tough things because of the conflict in the area. Even though life can be
      challenging,
      I love my hometown and the people in it. Bethlehem is full of history and love,
      and I'm proud to call it home.
